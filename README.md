## Pre-processing data
Scripts are in `/scripts`.

Google Earth Engine scripts are in [this EE repo](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/carderne/giz) (not currently publicly accessible).

### Extracting OSM features

[Schools](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Education_features)
```bash
osmfilter moz.o5m --keep="amenity=school" | \
    ogr2ogr -f GPKG osm-schools.gpkg /vsistdin/ multipolygons points
```

Then use the script to merge the polygons and points into a single later:
```bash
./scripts/merge_centroids.py data/osm/osm-schools.gpkg data/osm/osm-schools.gpkg
```

[Health facilities](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:healthcare)
```
osmfilter moz.o5m --keep="healthcare=*" | \
    ogr2ogr -f GPKG osm-health.gpkg /vsistdin/ multipolygons points
```
Based on examination, the OCHA health site data is much more complete, and includes most of the OSM sites, so the OSM data will not be used for health sites.

Grid lines:
```bash
osmfilter moz.o5m --keep="power=line" | ogr2ogr -f GPKG osm-grid.gpkg /vsistdin/ lines
```

### Urban level
GHSL SMOD

Use QGIS Raster -> Merge to merge/mosaic four tiles covering Mozambique.

Warp/reproject to EPSG:4326 (nearest neighbour, nodata 0).

Urban codes are as follows:
11: Mostly uninhabited
12: Rural, dispersed area
13: Village
21: Suburbs
22: Semi-dense town
23: Dense town
30: City

### Agriculture
A [reference paper](https://www.scielo.br/pdf/pab/v47n9/12.pdf).

Script `./scripts/ee_download.py ndvi` will download a timeseries of NDVI data. Can also download MODIS NDVI data with `./scripts/ee_download.py modis` Notebook `ndvi_analysis.ipynb` used to calculate Fourier transform and identify zones of agricultural productivity.

Currently just using 3rd component (counting from 1) of Fourier transform.

### Emissions
Script `./scripts/ee_download.py no2` will download a single maximum annual value of NO2 for Mozambique.

### Add distance to cities
Using [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Mozambique_by_population) with the following list of the 17 largest cities in Mozambique:

With the OCHA Main Cities dataset, use the following filter query in QGIS to get the selected cities:
```
"TOPONIMO" IN ('Cidade da Matola', 'Maputo', 'Nampula', 'Beira', 'Chimoio',
    'Quelimane', 'Tete', 'Cidade de Nacala', 'Lichinga', 'Pemba', 'Mocuba',
    'GuruÃ©', 'Xai-Xai', 'Maxixe', 'Angoche', 'Inhambane', 'Cuamba')
```

## Administrative layers
### Attributes to add

| Attribute              | Name      | Unit    | Source           | Comments |
| ---------              | ----      | ----    | ------           | -------- |
| Province               | adm1      |         | OCHA             | |
| Province code          | adm1_code |         | OCHA             | |
| District               | adm2      |         | OCHA             | |
| District code          | adm2_code |         | OCHA             | |
| Posto                  | adm3      |         | OCHA             | |
| Posto code             | adm3_code |         | OCHA             | |
| Population             | pop       |         | HRSL             | |
| Area                   | area      | km2     |                  | |
| Electricity access     | prov_elec |         | USAID            | Only at province level |
| Poverty rate           | prov_pov  |         | OPHI             | Only at province level |
| Health facilities      | health    |         | OCHA             | |
| Schools                | schools   |         | OSM              | |

### Add attributes
The OCHA data is used as a base.
First need to manually enter the electricity access figures from USAID, and OPHI's MPI (Multidimensional Poverty Index) into the Province (adm1) layer.
Add these as fields `prov_elec` and `prov_pov` and save the file.

Then use the script:
```bash
./scripts/admin_attributes.py
```

## Clusters
### Creating clusters
The command below runs a script that does the following steps, which can also be run in QGIS:
1. Resample to 0.001 degrees and drop pixels below a threshold
2. Polygonize then fix geometries
3. Add area column $area, and filter area > 13000
4. Buffer 0.005, then fix geometries
5. Dissolve
6. Multipart to singlepart

```bash
./scripts/make_clusters.py
```

### Attributes to add to clusters

| Demand                 | demand    | kW      |                  | |

Demand is calculated according to the following formula:
```
demand_pp   = 0.0852   # kW/person
intercept   = -12.44   # kW
health_mult = 20       # multiple of per person demand
school_mult = 20       # multiple of per person demand

demand = (
    pop * demand_pp
    + health * health_mult * demand_pp
    + schools * school_mult * demand_pp
    + intercept
)
```

The cluster score is calculated using a z-score and weighting for each of the following attributes:
| Attributes | Weighting |
| ---------- | --------- |
| pop        | 0.4       |
| popd       | 0.1       |
| grid       | 0.3       |
| health     | 0.1       |
| schools    | 0.1       |

### Add attributes
Run this script:
```bash
./scripts/cluster_attributes.py all scratch
```

Can also run with names of features to add instead of all. If `scratch` is included, it starts from the base clusters with no attributes, otherwise it reads in the file with attributes already added, and will overwrite attributes as needed.
```bash
./scripts/cluster_features.py pop,ntl
```

### Manually add settlement names
1. Using IOM settlements data for settlements.
2. In QGIS use `Voronoi polygons` with settlements, 30% buffer.
3. Then use `Join attributes by location`. Input layer: clusters; join layer: voronoi; predicate: intersects; fields to add: "Sett_Name"; join type: first located; discard records: yes.
4. Rename new field to `name`.

### Manually add nearest city name
1. Use filtered cities file.
2. Use `Voronoi polygons` with cities, 30% buffer.
3. Then use `Join attributes by location`. Input layer: clusters; join layer: voronoi; predicate: intersects; fields to add: "TOPONIMO"; join type: first located; discard records: yes. Rename new field to `name`.
4. Rename new field to `city`.
